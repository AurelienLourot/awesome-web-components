## Best Practices

* [Web Components best practices](http://webcomponents.org/articles/web-components-best-practices/) Web Components (WC) are a new set of web platform features that enable developers to build applications in a declarative, composable way. 
* [How should I name my element?](http://webcomponents.org/articles/how-should-i-name-my-element/) Naming is always a challenging task when developing a component. We can create truly complex pieces of code but we still have a hard time to name a simple variable.
* [WEB COMPONENTS AND YOU – DANGERS TO AVOID](http://christianheilmann.com/2014/04/18/web-components-and-you-dangers-to-avoid/) Web Components are a hot topic now. Creating widgets on the web that are part of the browser’s rendering flow is amazing. 
* [Melhores Práticas Web Components PT-br](http://tableless.com.br/melhores-praticas-web-components/) Conheça práticas simples que podem ajudar na organização do seu web component.
* [The Web’s Declarative, Composable Future](http://addyosmani.com/blog/the-webs-declarative-composable-future/) This year, the platform is getting Web Components, bringing forward a way to make the relationships between markup and behaviour a lot less vague when you’re looking at the HTML.


## Style Guides

* [Google Web Components Style Guide](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/style-guide) This guide serves as an extension to the Google JavaScript Style Guide with additional style guidance around authoring Web Components, particuarly those in this element collection. It is targeted at Google engineers, but may be useful for others too.


## Performance

## Libraries

* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) Polymer is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components, and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.
* [X-Tag](http://x-tags.org/) X-Tag is a small JavaScript library, created and supported by Mozilla, that brings Web Components Custom Element capabilities to all modern browsers.
* [Bosonic](http://bosonic.github.io/) Bosonic is a set of tools that enable you to build Web Components as the spec currently describes, and supporting not-so-modern browsers like IE9.
* [Polymer Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/polymer/) Polymer.dart is a Dart port of Polymer. Build Web Components with Dart, and interoperate with Web Components built with JavaScript.
